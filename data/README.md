# Data
As putting all dataset would be too heavy, we just provide all synthetic datasets (`Syn_Const`, `Syn_Gro` and `Syn_Sh`) and one of the semi-synthetic generated with DynamizeGraph (`Amazon_setting1`). All other semi-synthetic datasets can be found in the folder containing DynamizeGraph generator.
